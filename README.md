## 📖 Description

NetPractice is a network configuration training project designed to develop practical understanding of TCP/IP addressing and network topology. The project presents a series of networking exercises where you configure network devices to establish proper communication between hosts.

The goal is to master fundamental networking concepts by solving increasingly complex scenarios involving IP addressing, subnet masks, routing tables, and network segmentation. Each level requires configuring network interfaces, routers, and establishing routes to ensure all devices can communicate according to specific requirements.

Through hands-on problem-solving, this project builds essential skills for network administration, system configuration, and understanding how data flows across interconnected systems.

## 📡 Networking Fundamentals

### IP Address Overview

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host and providing the location of the host in the network.

<img width="800" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb50557-13a1-4182-b1a6-f6fb18b5f816" />

**Structure:**
- IPv4 addresses consist of **4 bytes (32 bits)** total
- Written in dotted decimal notation: `192.168.1.1`
- Each byte (octet) ranges from **0 to 255**
- Example breakdown:
  - `192.168.1.1`
  - Binary: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`
  - Each section is 8 bits (1 byte)

**Address Classes:**
- **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (Large networks)
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (Medium networks)
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (Small networks)

### Public IP vs Private IP

<img width="922" height="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed3cb21-2a09-489c-b675-d0062adf98bf" />

**Public IP Addresses:**
- Globally unique addresses assigned by ISPs
- Routable on the internet
- Visible to the outside world
- Used to identify your network on the internet
- Example: `203.0.113.5`

**Private IP Addresses (RFC 1918):**
Reserved address ranges for internal networks, not routable on the internet:

- **Class A**: `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255` (10.0.0.0/8)
- **Class B**: `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255` (172.16.0.0/12)
- **Class C**: `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255` (192.168.0.0/16)

**Key Differences:**
- Private IPs allow multiple devices to share one public IP via NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Private networks are isolated from direct internet access
- Routers translate private IPs to public IPs for internet communication
- Private IPs can be reused across different organizations

---

### Subnet Mask

A **subnet mask** determines which portion of an IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.

**Purpose:**
- Divides IP address into network and host portions
- Enables network segmentation and organization
- Controls the size of a network (number of available hosts)

**Common Subnet Masks:**

| CIDR Notation | Subnet Mask | Usable Hosts | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| /8 | 255.0.0.0 | 16,777,214 | Massive networks |
| /16 | 255.255.0.0 | 65,534 | Large organizations |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | Small office networks |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 126 | Small departments |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | Very small subnets |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | Point-to-point links |

**Example:**
- IP: `192.168.1.10`
- Mask: `255.255.255.0` (/24)
- Network: `192.168.1.0`
- Host portion: `.10`
- Broadcast: `192.168.1.255`
- Usable range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`

**Calculation Tips:**
- /24 means the first 24 bits are network, last 8 bits are host
- Formula for usable hosts: 2^(host bits) - 2
- Subtract 2 for network address and broadcast address

---

### Router

A **router** is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks based on IP addresses.

**Key Functions:**
- **Connects different networks**: Links separate IP networks together
- **Routes traffic**: Determines the best path for data packets
- **Maintains routing tables**: Stores information about network destinations
- **Network segmentation**: Isolates broadcast domains

**Router Components:**
- **Interfaces**: Each interface connects to a different network
- **Routing Table**: Contains destination networks and next-hop information
- **Default Gateway**: Router's IP address used by hosts to reach other networks

**Routing Table Example:**
```
Destination     | Next Hop      | Interface
----------------|---------------|----------
192.168.1.0/24  | 0.0.0.0       | eth0 (directly connected)
10.0.0.0/8      | 192.168.1.254 | eth0
0.0.0.0/0       | 172.16.0.1    | eth1 (default route)
```

**Important Concepts:**
- **Default Route (0.0.0.0/0)**: The path used when no specific route matches
- **Next Hop**: The IP address of the next router in the path
- **Directly Connected**: Networks attached to the router's interfaces
- Routers operate at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model

**In NetPractice:**
- Each router interface must have an IP in the network it connects to
- Routers need routes to reach non-directly-connected networks
- The default gateway on hosts points to the router interface IP

---

### Switch

A **switch** is a network device that connects multiple devices within the same network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.

**Key Functions:**
- **Connects devices in a LAN**: Links computers, printers, and servers
- **Layer 2 operation**: Works at the Data Link layer using MAC addresses
- **MAC address table**: Learns which devices are on which ports
- **Broadcasts**: Forwards broadcasts to all connected devices

**How Switches Work:**
1. Receives frame on a port
2. Reads destination MAC address
3. Looks up MAC in address table
4. Forwards frame only to the destination port (or floods if unknown)

**Switch vs Router:**

| Feature | Switch | Router |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **OSI Layer** | Layer 2 (Data Link) | Layer 3 (Network) |
| **Addressing** | MAC addresses | IP addresses |
| **Purpose** | Connect devices in same network | Connect different networks |
| **Broadcast Domain** | Forwards broadcasts | Blocks broadcasts |
| **Intelligence** | Learns MAC addresses | Makes routing decisions |

**In NetPractice:**
- Switches are transparent (don't need configuration)
- All devices connected to a switch are in the same network
- Switches don't separate networks—use routers for that

---

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

**ARP** is a protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.

**Why ARP is Needed:**
- Network Layer (Layer 3) uses IP addresses
- Data Link Layer (Layer 2) uses MAC addresses
- ARP bridges the gap between these layers

**ARP Request Process:**

1. **Host wants to communicate**: Host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to Host B (192.168.1.20)
2. **ARP Request (Broadcast)**:
   - Host A broadcasts: "Who has 192.168.1.20? Tell 192.168.1.10"
   - Sent to MAC address: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (broadcast)
   - All devices on the network receive it
3. **ARP Reply (Unicast)**:
   - Host B responds: "192.168.1.20 is at MAC 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
   - Sent directly to Host A's MAC address
4. **Cache the mapping**:
   - Host A stores this in its ARP cache for future use
   - Cache expires after a timeout (typically 20 minutes)

**ARP Cache Example:**
```
IP Address      | MAC Address          | Type
----------------|----------------------|--------
192.168.1.1     | 00:11:22:33:44:55   | Dynamic
192.168.1.20    | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E   | Dynamic
192.168.1.254   | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF   | Dynamic
```

**Key Points:**
- ARP only works within the same subnet/broadcast domain
- Switches forward ARP broadcasts to all ports
- Routers do not forward ARP broadcasts (boundary of broadcast domain)
- ARP is vulnerable to spoofing attacks (ARP poisoning)

**Commands to View ARP:**
- Linux/Mac: `arp -a`
- Windows: `arp -a`
- Clear cache: `arp -d` (may require admin privileges)
